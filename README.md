# Wordle Solver

Wordle solver for Wordle with numbers. The word is a sequence of n digits and the solver aims to guess it. This solver begins with guess [0,0,0,0,0] and increments every digit that is not correctly placed for its next guess until it is correct.


The, O(n) = 1 as there are only 10 digits so 10 guesses at most required.
